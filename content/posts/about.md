The Stellar Project is about creating a platform for containers by using
lightweight composable services.  It is about re-thinking how we run
services from the ground up by starting from an optimized kernel all the
way to replaceable orchestrators all while picking and choosing what you
want and what you do not.  The goal is to have infrastructure as simple
and automated as possible.
